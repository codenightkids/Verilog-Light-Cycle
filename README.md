Verilog-Light-Cycle
===================

A "Light Cycle" Game made in verilog. Was made for a embedded systems class, and we kind of over did it.

We haven't refactored anything since the class ended. We were pushed at the end to get the tails working, so a lot of the comments may seem out of "sync",
and the code might trick you some. Sorry about this, we'll clean it up sooner than later.
